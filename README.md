# Emacs Stress Tests

Experimenting with some ideas around benchmarking Emacs itself.

Nothing to see here yet.

## Ideas

Performance:

* Font lock in a large C file.
* Moving to the end of a large single-line file.
* Existing regexp engine benchmarks.
* Numeric calculations.
* List manipulations.
* Startup time.

Memory usage:

* Measuring memory usage at startup, and after opening a large number
  of buffers.
